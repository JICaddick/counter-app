# Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

Why use Redux? --> This is the most concise explanation I've seen, taken from Mark Erikson's blog - https://www.newline.co/fullstack-react/articles/redux-with-mark-erikson/

React is great, and it’s entirely possible to write a complete application using nothing but React. However, as an application gets more complex, sometimes it’s not as straightforward to use plain old React. Using a state management library like Redux can alleviate some of the issues that crop up in more complex applications.

- Predictable state updates make it easier to understand how the data flow works in the application
- The use of "pure" reducer functions makes logic easier to test, and enables useful features like "time-travel debugging".
- Centralizing the state makes it easier to implement things like logging changes to the data, or persisting data between page refreshes
